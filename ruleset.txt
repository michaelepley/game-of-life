# How the algorithm determines if a cell lives or dies:
# 1.  For each neighbor of a given cell and the cell itself, the
#     following "life" score is assigned:
#        DefaultDeadWeight+DefaultLiveWeight*GetAgeWeight(Age,AgeweightList)
# 2.  All the weights are then summed together.  If the sum is:
#     A.  equal to a birth point and it is not alive, it becomes
#         alive
#     B.  less than or equal to the Minimum for life when the
#         Minimum for life is a single number and the cell is
#         presently alive, it will continue to live
#     C.  equal to a number in the range of Minimum for life when
#         the minimum for life is more than one number and the cell
#         is presently alive, it will continue to live, otherwise it
#         will die
#     D.  Greater than or equal to the Die from overcrowding at when
#         this is a single number and the cell is presently alive,
#         it will die
#     E.  Equal to a number in the range of Die from overcrowding at
#         when this is a range of numbers and the cell is presently
#         alive, it will die
#     F.  Otherwise, the cell remains unchanged

# GENERAL FORMAT:
#------------------
# 1.  NAME
# 2.  birth point(s) --- comma seperated list or range #-#
# 3.  Minimum for Life (at least this many), if a list or range, the neigbor count must equal one of the numbers in the list
# 4.  Die from overcrowding at
# 5.  List of age weights for the cell itself
# 6.  List of age weights for the lower left cell
#
# AGE WEIGHT LIST FORMAT:
# 1.  An integer for the default Dead weight.  This is minimum "life score" if the cell is dead (age=0)
# 2.  An integer for the default Dead weight.
#
# Conway's rule set is the original, and about the only
# interesting one around.
